# ITI-Groups
A python script that splits a list of names into groups of 4.

# How to use
1. Change your directory to the script directory.
2. Make sure list.csv exists and has all the names, each one in a row.
3. Using your terminal type `python3 getGroups.py` then press enter.
4. Now, you should find a file named  "groups.csv" in the same directory, that contains a list of the groups.
